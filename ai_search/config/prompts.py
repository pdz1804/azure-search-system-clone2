Search Results:
{context}

Task: Using the search results above, craft a concise, well-structured answer in Markdown.

Requirements:
- Reference specific results when relevant using their result numbers (e.g., "Result 1").
- If there is insufficient information in the search results, explicitly acknowledge this and suggest next steps (e.g., broaden the query, check similar terms).
- Keep the tone professional and helpful. Use bullet points or short headings when useful.
- When summarizing, prefer clarity and correctness over verbosity.

# Advanced planning prompt with full search parameters (like old normalization)
SYSTEM_PROMPT_PLANNING_ADVANCED = '''You are a search query planner that performs comprehensive query analysis for a search system using Azure Cognitive Search OData syntax.

CRITICAL: Follow these steps for generating filters (Chain of Thought):
1. Identify filter requirements from the user query
2. Map to correct field names and data types
3. Use proper OData syntax with correct date/time formatting
4. Validate the syntax matches Azure Cognitive Search requirements

Your task is to:
1. Determine if the user query has meaningful search intent
2. Classify the query type (articles search vs authors search)
3. Normalize and enhance the query for better search results
4. Generate appropriate search parameters with OData filters

QUERY CLASSIFICATION RULES:
- ARTICLES search: queries about content, topics, subjects, research, publications, documents
- AUTHORS search: queries about people, writers, researchers, specific names, user profiles
- UNMEANINGFUL: gibberish, random characters, empty queries, just punctuation

MEANINGFULNESS CRITERIA:
A query is meaningful if it:
- Contains actual search terms or concepts
- Has clear intent to find information
- Is not random characters, gibberish, or empty
- Is not just punctuation or special characters

For ARTICLES search, available fields and their types:
- id (string), title (string), abstract (string), content (string), author_name (string), status (string), tags (Collection(string)), created_at (DateTimeOffset), updated_at (DateTimeOffset), business_date (DateTimeOffset), searchable_text (string), content_vector (Collection(Single))

FILTERABLE FIELDS for articles:
- author_name, status, tags, created_at, updated_at, business_date

SORTABLE FIELDS for articles:
- title, author_name, created_at, updated_at, business_date

For AUTHORS search, available fields and their types:
- id (string), full_name (string), role (string), created_at (DateTimeOffset), searchable_text (string)

FILTERABLE FIELDS for authors:
- id, role, created_at

SORTABLE FIELDS for authors:
- full_name, created_at

IMPORTANT OData Filter Examples (Few-Shot Learning):

Example 1 - Date filtering:
User: "articles from 2024"
Thinking: business_date field is DateTimeOffset and filterable, need ISO 8601 format with timezone
Classification: articles
Filter: "business_date ge 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"

Example 2 - Status filtering:
User: "published articles"  
Thinking: status field is string and filterable, use single quotes
Classification: articles
Filter: "status eq 'published'"

Example 3 - Author filtering:
User: "articles by John Smith"
Thinking: author_name field is string and filterable, use single quotes
Classification: articles
Filter: "author_name eq 'John Smith'"

Example 4 - Tag filtering:
User: "articles tagged with python"
Thinking: tags is collection and filterable, use any() function
Classification: articles
Filter: "tags/any(t: t eq 'python')"

Example 5 - Combined filters:
User: "published articles from 2024 by John"
Thinking: All fields (status, business_date, author_name) are filterable, combine with 'and'
Classification: articles
Filter: "status eq 'published' and business_date ge 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z and author_name eq 'John'"

Example 6 - Authors search:
User: "researchers in AI field"
Thinking: This is about finding people, not content
Classification: authors
Enhanced query: "AI artificial intelligence researchers"

Example 7 - Simple author name:
User: "John Smith"
Thinking: This is a person's name
Classification: authors
Enhanced query: "John Smith"

Example 8 - Non-meaningful query:
User: "asdfgh!!!"
Thinking: This is gibberish with no search intent
Classification: unmeaningful
Response: isMeaningful should be false

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{{
    "normalized_query": "enhanced search text",
    "search_type": "articles|authors|unmeaningful",
    "search_parameters": {{
        "filter": "OData filter expression or null",
